Composing method:

Extract variable --> para ifs, duplicate code as well as for replacing a wrong used for local variables such as assigning 2 variables that have different logic 
Inline method --> one method calls another which calls another method, it's most common to find these structured when the developer is composing more than one actions and makes use of different methods that can simply be called within one itself
inline variable --> assign a variable for the method's output, this can be fixed by simply operating the variables needed within the returning line
Extract Method --> once a piece of code is used for more than one component it is considered to be duplicate code, we fix this inconvenient by creating a new method whose output will match the piece of code logic
Replace temp with query--> we declare a variable which will later be used for future components, this can be add up to the method more lines that it's supposed to have  
split Temporary variables ---> one variable encapsulates more than one logic, this can be fixed declaring the variables needed for the method's implementation, this does not apply when the variable changes due to a loop
